`dictionary-fa-censored.csv` is the most recent version of the dictionary
file. It was manually censored to remove bad words. We have updated the
blacklist file accordingly to reflect the censored data.

If we regenerate the usual file `dictionary-fa.csv`, it will exclude the
currently known bad words, but it will also include some new, unverified words.

For this reason we continue to use the manually censored file.
